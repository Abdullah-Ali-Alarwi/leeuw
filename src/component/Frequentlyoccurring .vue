    <h1 class="title">Frequently occurring treatments</h1>
    <p>
      India offers all possible medical fields and thus you are able to come to India for any  medical need under the guidance of Leeuw. However, the following type of treatments  we see especially frequent. Many oncology patients come to India to undergo surgery,  remove a tumor or receive chemotherapy. Many patients also travel to India to receive  organ transplants like kidneys or heart valves. We have also guided many patients with  heart conditions or those requiring heart repair after a heart attack. Patients traveling for  joint replacement like a knee are also common. Patients suffering from a neurological  condition also come to India for treatment of spinal injuries or to help with the aftermath  of a stroke.    </p>
