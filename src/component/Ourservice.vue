                Leeuw uses telemedicine (medical service through technology) to delivery health care,  for example by organising conference calls between doctors and hospitals in India and  doctors abroad to facilitate information sharing on the latest medical practices and  technologies.Â           
              </p>
<p>
    For critical cases, telemedicine enables the provision of a diagnosis and the necessary  treatment. A specialist in India is able to observe an ongoing surgery online and can  guide and instruct a foreign doctor.

            <p class="text-title">Hands-on services for medical professionals</p>
            <p>
                We organise consultations for which Indian medical professionals visit hospitals abroad  for the purpose of advising patients in their home country, enabling a diagnosis to be  made and a treatment to be suggested. With this service we aim to improve healthcare  locally, especially in locations without regular access to medical care.            </p>

                <p>
                    We also offer a service to organise medical conferences during which Indian and foreign  medical professionals can meet face to face and discuss the latest practices and  technologies and to exchange experiences and knowledge with a focus on preventative  care and health education.
