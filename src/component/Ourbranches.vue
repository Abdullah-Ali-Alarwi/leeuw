      Leeuw International Care is an Indian registered company and we are headquartered in  Bangalore. We have also founded branches in Sana'a in Yemen, Muscat in Oman, Ryad  in Saudi Arabia and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Future plans include branches in  Dhaka, Bangladesh and Djibouti. The majority of our patients therefore come from these  countries but we have also served European patients and patients from the United  States.  If you prefer to be treated in a country other than India, Leeuw will be able to assist you  in your preferred country.
